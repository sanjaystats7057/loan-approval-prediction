Predicting loan approval using XGBoost, SMOTE, and feature selection
# 🏦 Credit Risk Analysis using XGBoost & Random Forest

This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be approved or not based on historical financial data. With over 1 million data points, we perform end-to-end Credit Risk Analysis using supervised machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Problem Statement

To predict the risk of loan default based on customer financial behavior and demographic features. The goal is to help financial institutions assess creditworthiness effectively using machine learning models.

## 📈 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- Checked for missing values  
- Visualized class imbalance  
- Plotted distributions of income, credit score, expenses, etc.  
- Correlation heatmap to identify important features

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

| Model             | Accuracy | AUC Score | After SMOTE |
|------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Random Forest     | 75%      | 0.80      | ✅            |
| XGBoost (Tuned)   | 75%      | 0.80      | ✅            |
